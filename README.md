VoKS-desktop
============

This project constitutes the OSX and Windows desktop application as part of the BComeSafe alarm system. Its purpose is to let users trigger the alarm, stream audio and video to the Shelter, and communicate textually with the shelter.

The application is written in HTML5, which is then wrapped with an interpreter into an executable for each of the target platforms.
